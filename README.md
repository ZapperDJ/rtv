# rtv
A pseudo-live TV implementation to save bandwidth but still function normally.

**[See it in action, pseudo-live!](https://zapperdj.github.io/rtv/)**

## CHANGES

This is a fork of [RTV](https://github.com/myrtv/myrtv.github.io) with some changes inspired by [YTCH](https://ytch.tv), [FreeTVz](https://freetvz.com) and [CouchTube](https://github.com/ozencb/couchtube) 

- Hid and disabled YouTube UI / controls
- Made menubar floating
- Added power, volume, channel change, mute, subtitles, and open on YouTube buttons
- Removed resync button as power button replaces it
- Updated FontAwesome
- Changed autohide sidebar button to hide controls button

This changes were tested against youtube, most of them will not work on dailymotion / direct links

#### What does that even mean?
When you *tune in* to RTV it obtains a playlist, which has a defined starting point in history (yesterday, 10 years ago, whatever). It proceeds to determine, had that same playlist been repeating since it started, what is currently *on* right now.

#### Won't this use a ton of bandwidth?
**No!** Only if *you* let it. You only watch what is currently playing and the provider of the video is only active when there is at least one viewer so both sides benefit from only transferring what they must but maintaining sync while "offline".

#### Why not use something like a website that syncs YouTube videos, or a YouTube playlist?    
This is unmanaged and "continually broadcasts", even when there's nobody left to watch. It does not require someone to make a room, load up some videos, or even interact with it to maintain a sync each time somebody feels like watching. The stream is always available where it's expected to be.

#### Why are all these answers mostly the same?
Because it's that simple. There are only a few instances of smoke and mirrors to maintain the sync, most of the experience comes from the variety of channels and the intricate guide. It's a direct competitor to YouTube syncing sites, but also itself is a unique feature over them. It also works locally/self-hosted if you want to roll your own.

RTV provides a *ton* of channels, probably not as diverse as all would like. To alleviate that, [Custom Channels](https://github.com/myrtv/myrtv.github.io/wiki/Custom-Channels) are supported.
